I am a frequent traveller and a nature lover. My wife and I take every opportunity that we get to travel to naturally beautiful places away from the hustle and bustle of New York City. During those travels we have come to experience first hand the effects of climate change. I believe that climate change is the biggest crisis facing our world today. 

As a resident of NYC, I decided to take a look at what my home city is doing to avoid the worst effects of climate change. 

### Background ###

The cornerstone of NYC's climate change policy is the goal of "80 by 50", an 80% reduction in greenhouses gas emissions from 2005 levels by 2050. Of citywide greenhouse gas emissions in the baseline year of 2005, 68% can be attributed to buildings, 27% to transportation and 5% to waste. For my analysis, I decided to take a deep dive into the 68% of emissions from buildings. This covers the energy used to power, heat, and cool buildings, which includes emissions from burning fossil fuels both onsite (for heat and hot water), and in power plants (to generate electricity).  

### Data ###

In 2009, NYC introduced local law 84, which required owners of buildings over 50,000 gross square feet to report their energy and water consumption annually. This law was the first in NYC to require energy information from private building owners, and serves as a primary means of tracking progress on achieving the goals of "80 by 50". There are now four years of data from local law 84 (2011 through 2014) available through the [NYC Open Data platform](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Energy-and-Water-Data-Disclosure-for-Local-Law-84-/q39e-7gbs).

### Analysis ###

2011 was first year of data collection, and since there was only sparse data for this year, I excluded it from my analysis. Another challenge I faced was that data for subsequent years was riddled with outliers, since building owners were not penalized for inaccurate submissions to the city.

Based on guidance from an engineer who was involved in retrofitting NYC buildings to improve their energy consumption, I used a Site Energy Utilization of 60,000 KBtu/Sq.Ft to remove outliers. I was able to confirm that my data set is in the correct ball park after comparing total building greenhouse gas emissions to a report published by NYC mayor's office of sustainability in 2014.

In 2014, multifamily housing, office buildings and hotels were the top contributors to NYC's greenhouse gas emissions. Nearly 90% of NYC's greenhouse gas emissions came from these three building categories.

In my analysis I also found that multifamily housing has made improvements in reducing greenhouse gases per square foot.  This trend in reduction might be attributed to another initiative by NYC to phase out oil boilers using #4 and #6 fuel in the next 20 years.  

Hotels and office buildings have increased their greenhouse gas emissions per square foot over the period.

Here's another interesting finding. The top decile of buildings, when deciled by greenhouse gas emissions per square foot, produced nearly 75% of city's greenhouse gas emissions.

As part of the initiative to phase out #4 and #6 oil use in the next 20 years, NYC Department of Environmental Protection launched a program requiring all buildings with oil boilers to register with the city. This registration data is available for year 2014 on NYC Open Data. I was able to extend my analysis further using this new data set.

Contrary to the popular belief that boilers are responsible for most of NYC's greenhouse gas emissions, the data shows a different picture. Oil boilers are responsible for less that 13% of the city's greenhouse gas emissions.

I took a look at the relationship between greenhouse gas emissions and floor area. Interestingly certain small buildings are worst offenders when it comes to greenhouse gas emissions. A large aggregation of boilers is in smaller buildings and is somewhat responsible for increased greenhouse gas emissions. However, the relationship is not that clear.

I also explored the relationship between energy usage per square foot and greenhouse gas emissions per square foot. There seems to be a strong linear relationship.

With a little bit of math I was able to calculate per square foot reduction of greenhouse gas emissions needed to achieve the goal of 80 by 50.

### Calculations ###

* 2005 Total GHG emissions per square foot: 0.02033637 (MtCO2e/ft2)
* 2014 Total GHG emissions per square foot: 0.01980642 (MtCO2e/ft2)
* Target GHG emissions per square foot: 0.00432984 (MtCO2e/ft2)
* Reduction in GHG emissions per square foot Needed to achieve 2050 target: 0.01547658 (MtCO2e/ft2)

In my opinion, it would be easier to entice building owners to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions if cost savings can be shown through retrofits that produce less greenhouse gas emissions. In my project I will continue to explore if energy savings from retrofits can finance costs of retrofitting or overhauling existing systems in buildings.
