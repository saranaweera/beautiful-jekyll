title: Who is Shihan?
subtitle: Everything you need to know about me
---

My name is Shihan Ranaweera. I am a Data Scientist and a former Quantitative Analyst. Prior to my time as a Quant I've held roles in software development implementing software solutions for trading and portfolio management functions at invesment management firms.

What else do you need?

I am generally an easy going person with an islander mentality. My wife and I are avid travellers, and love exploring and experiencing cultures across the globe.

### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
