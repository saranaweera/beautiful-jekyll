My name is Shihan Ranaweera. I am a Data Scientist and a former Quantitative Analyst. Prior to my time as a Quant I've held roles in software development implementing software solutions for trading and portfolio management functions at invesment management firms.

### What else?

I am generally an easy going person with an innate curiousity for new skills and experiences. My wife and I are avid travellers, and love exploring and experiencing different cultures across the globe.
